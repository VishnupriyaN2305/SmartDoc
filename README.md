A Disease Prediction Model

Compiler Design Project

The development and exploitation of several prominent Data mining techniques in numerous real<br>
world application areas (e.g. Industry, Healthcare and Bio science) has led to the utilisation of such <br>
techniques in machine learning environments, in order to extract useful pieces of information from <br>
the specified data in healthcare communities, biomedical fields etc. Diseases and health related <br>
problems like malaria, dengue, Impetigo, Diabetes, Migraine, Jaundice, Chickenpox etc., cause <br>
significant effect on one’s health and sometimes might also lead to death if ignored. The healthcare <br>
industry can make effective decision making by “mining” the huge database they possess i.e. by <br>
extracting the hidden patterns and relationships in the database. Data mining algorithms like <br>
Decision Tree, Random Forest KNN and Naïve Bayes algorithms can give a remedy to this situation. <br>
Hence, we have developed an automated system that can discover and extract hidden knowledge <br>
associated with the diseases from a historical(diseases-symptoms) dataset according to the rule<br>
set by the respective algorithms.
